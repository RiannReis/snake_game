# snake_game
Inspired by the classic snake game. Made using python and the pygame library!

# How to use:

Clone the repo with:
```
git clone git@github.com:RiannReis/snake_game.git
```

Need to have python installed and use pip for install pygame _(preferable in a venv)_
- `python -m venv env`
- `source env/bin/activate`
- `pip install pygame`
- Run and enjoy :D
